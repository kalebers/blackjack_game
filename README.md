# BlackJack Game

- BlackJack game, under development.

- To run the files, ensure that you have **poetry** installed to download all the right dependencies under the **pyproject.toml** file. 

- Run ```pip install poetry``` to install poetry in your machine, and then **inside of the blackjack proeject package**, run ```poetry install``` to install the right dependencies and right Python Version.

- The **pyproject.toml** file will create a **virtual env**, that you need to select in your IDE to be able to run the code and game. Usually , it will create the virtual env on the following Windows path:
``` C:\Users\your_user\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs``` and on MacOS: ```/Users/your_user/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs```, then select the wright environment created in the step before. (Change **your_user** for your user name).
